# Timezone-Bot
A simple Discord bot made for keeping track of timezones
> Author: Angel Bot<br>
> Version: Beta 1.1

# Setting Up
## Requirements
To use this bot, you will need [A Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime that is utilized by Timezone Bot. The latest version should work fine, but if you run into any issues, I recommend you try [Node.js Version 12.16.2](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.16.2/) instead.
## Updating the Dependencies
##### Windows
Run the [update-dependencies.cmd](https://github.com/AngelWyvern/Timezone-Bot/blob/beta/update-dependencies.cmd) file, and it should update the dependencies automatically. If you run into issues using the bot, you can try to run [force-compatibility.cmd](https://github.com/AngelWyvern/Timezone-Bot/blob/beta/force-compatibility.cmd) to install the recommended version of the dependencies.
##### OSX/Linux
Run the [update-dependencies.sh](https://github.com/AngelWyvern/Timezone-Bot/blob/beta/update-dependencies.sh) file in a terminal window, and it should update the dependencies automatically. If you run into issues using the bot, you can try to run [force-compatibility.sh](https://github.com/AngelWyvern/Timezone-Bot/blob/beta/force-compatibility.sh) to install the recommended version of the dependencies.
